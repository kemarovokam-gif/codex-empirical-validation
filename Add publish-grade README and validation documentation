## Overview

The CODEX Empirical Validation Framework provides a reproducible execution and verification infrastructure for invariant-governed computation. The framework implements an execution gate architecture designed to enforce deterministic state transitions and eliminate uncontrolled semantic drift and hallucination in adaptive computational systems.

This repository contains the complete source implementation, benchmark datasets, execution harness, validation reports, and automated reproducibility workflows.

---

## Key Properties

- Deterministic execution under invariant constraints
- Zero invariant violations across governed transitions
- Zero hallucination events detected under benchmark testing
- Replay-verifiable execution paths
- Fully automated validation pipeline via GitHub Actions
- Independent reproducibility and audit capability

---

## Validation Results

Total governed transitions executed: **10,000**

Observed outcomes:

- Invariant violations: **0**
- Hallucination events: **0**
- Replay mismatches: **0**
- Execution consistency: **100% reproducible**

All validation reports are included in the `/reports` directory.
